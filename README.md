dotfiles
=================

This project contains my config files for the following programs. Feel free to use the entire files or snippets from them for your own use

 - vim/macvim
 - bash
 - git

Installation
================

Download or clone the entire source code from github and then run the following command.

`sh setup-links.sh`

This command will create symbolic references in the home directory. If the config files exists already, then they are not overwritten.


License
================

The source code and the config files are released under "THE BEER-WARE" license.

I would, however, consider it a great courtesy if you could email me and tell me about your project and how this code was used, just for my own continued personal gratification :)
